<br/>
In the factory ,there are many parts that work together to help it function. These three parts are:
<br/>
<br/>
PARTS OF A LUNG-
<br/>
The lungs are a pair of air-sacs located on either side of the chest. The windpipes(trachea) take air into the lungs through its tubular branches called bronchi. The bronchi then divides into smaller branches called bronchioles, finally becoming microscopic. The diaphragm is a thin skeletal muscle that sits at the base of the chest and separates the abdomen from the chest. It contracts and flattens when you breathe in and out.
<br/>
<br/>
ORGANS OF THE SYSTEM-
<br/>
The respiratory system consists of all the organs involved in breathing. These include the trachea, bronchus, bronchioles, alveoli and diaphragm.
<br/>
<br/>
TRANSPORT OF AIR-
<br/>
The air that we breathe in enters through the nose or mouth, flows through the throat (pharynx) and the voice box (larynx). Then, it enters the windpipes (trachea). The trachea divides into two hollow tubes called bronchi. When it reaches the end of the air sacks (alveoli), it flows through the capillaries where the gas exchange takes place.
