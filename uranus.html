Our body works everyday with it's three assistants.  It's assistants are called Digestive system, Respiratory system, and Circulatory  system.  These are the three main  assistants that oUr body needs to function on a daily basis.  Our three assistants work hard and help each other when needed. Now each assistant has their own work. The Respiratory system helps us breathe and the air we breathe is present in our blood to burn sugar and acids and produce us with energy . This blood is used by the next assistant of our body which is the Circulatory system. This assistant helps circulate blood throughout our body  which is helped by the Respiratory system. The energy we recieve is from the food we eat which is produced by the Digestive system. All these three assistants collaborate for the well being of our body and it is a cycle repeated again and again.
