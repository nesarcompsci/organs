SCENARIO-
<br/>
You go for your usual morning run, but today you go faster than usual. After 3 rounds you start getting tired so you sit down for a break. You look at your fitbit for steps and check your heart rate which is faster than regular days.
<br/>
How fast will your heart beat during this time?
