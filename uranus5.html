CIRCULATORY SYSTEM:
<br/>
In the transport system, there are many different parts that work together to help it function. These three parts are:
<br/>
<br/>
PARTS OF BLOOD-
<br/>
The main transport force consists of red blood cells, immune cells, and platelets. All of them have different tasks. The red blood cells carry and transport nutrients and oxygen with the help of haemoglobin. The immune cells are fewer in numbers but are much larger and stronger than red blood cells. They are used to protect other cells from foreign intruders. The platelets heal any exterior problems by interlocking with each other to plug up any hole or breach. This is an essential part of the system.
<br/>
<br/>
PARTS OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM-
<br/>
The main work force in the system consists of one organ, the heart and all the blood pipes it connects to. The heart acts like a pump or a generator. It pushes away blood by squeezing itself and the blood inside the heart is pushed outside with a lot of force. This is an essential part of the system. 
<br/>
<br/>
TYPES OF BLOOD PIPES-
<br/>
There are many different pipes that act like roads for the blood. The types are as follows; aorta, arterioles, capillaries, superior and inferior vena cava, atrium, ventricle, pulmonary arteries,  pulmonary veins, etcâ€¦ 
All these pipes come under two groups;arteries and veins. Arteries carry blood that is transporting nutrients and the veins are the ones that travel back to the heart from where they are sent to the lungs to get a refill and begin the process again. This is an essential part of the system.
