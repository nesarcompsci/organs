SCENARIO-
<br/>
You are in a swimming race and you have prepared for a 25 metre race but the race you joined is a 100 metre race. You are well and fine for half the race, after which you slow down and start panting for breath. You managed to finish the race but ended up coming last as you slowed down.
<br/>
What if you had energy and completed the race but still lost breath?
